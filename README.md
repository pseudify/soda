# Soda 
Soda is the perfect option to manage your Discord community with ease.
Featuring a wide variety of commands, Soda is completely open source, 


# Features
Soda has a wide variety of commands. This ranges from your average moderation commands,
an entire ticket system, and even a "join to create" voice channel system.
Soda has it all.

Soda utilizes both Slash and Prefix commands. Whether you're still used to prefix commands,
or whether you prefer using slash commands. We understand the switch from prefix commands to slash commands is hard,
so we decided to implement both command types into Soda!
